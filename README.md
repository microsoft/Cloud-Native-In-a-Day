## Abstracts

### Workshop

Fabrikam Medical Conferences provides conference web site services, tailored to the medical community. Their business has grown and the management of many instances of the code base and change cycle per tenant has gotten out of control.

The goal of this workshop is to help them build a proof of concept (POC) that will migrate their code to a more manageable process that involves containerization of tenant code, a better DevOps workflow, and a simple lift-and-shift story for their database backend.

In this workshop, you will build a proof of concept (POC) that will transform an existing on-premises application to a container-based application. This POC will deliver a multi-tenant web app hosting solution leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Docker containers on Linux nodes, and a migration from MongoDB to Cosmos DB.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to improve the reliability of and increase the release cadence of your container-based applications through time-tested DevOps practices.

### Part I: Presentation
Start from presenting Cloud Native applications on Azure story using the [included deck.](Presentation)

### Part II: Whiteboard Design Session

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn about the choices related to building and deploying containerized applications in Azure, critical decisions around this, and other aspects of the solution, including ways to lift-and-shift parts of the application to reduce applications changes.

By the end of this design session, you will be better able to design solutions that target Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and define a DevOps workflow for containerized applications.



### Part III: Hands-on Lab

This hands-on lab is designed to guide you through the process of building and deploying Docker images to the Kubernetes platform hosted on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS), in addition to learning how to work with dynamic service discovery, service scale-out, and high-availability.

At the end of this lab, you will be better able to build and deploy containerized applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and perform common DevOps procedures.
